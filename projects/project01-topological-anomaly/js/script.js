  `a grace and a mercy`,

  `and their teeth shall devour and sustain`,
  `and herald the passing of an age.`,
  `That which dies shall still know life in death`,
  `for all that decays is not forgotten`,
  `and reanimated it shall walk the world`,
  `in the bliss of not-knowing.`,
  `And then there shall be a fire`,
  `that knows the naming of you,`,
  `and in the presence of the strangling fruit,`,
  `its dark flame shall acquire`,
  `every part of you that remains.`
