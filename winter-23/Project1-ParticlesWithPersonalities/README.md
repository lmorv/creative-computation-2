# Lost in the Forest

## Ideation

### Brainstorm:

- Mouse tracking - getting lost or trying to find your way.
- revealing parts of an environment.
- Moss, tree bark, fairy sparkles - bright and magical.
- Spotlight of a flashlight in the darkness.
- Parallax of trees in the darkness.
- Shadow and light particles - occlusive VS light influence.
- Battlefront, Ewok Hunt - Fairy Fountain, The Legend of Zelda.
- color changes over time - day and night - weather conditions.
- fire, blood, water.

### Particle types and behavior:

- Tendrils.
    - originating from a point. trasform(), rotate().
    - drawVector, Bezier curves, svg library for p5.

- Blotches.

- Square 'brush strokes'.
    - Emanating from a point at an angle,

- Sparkles.
