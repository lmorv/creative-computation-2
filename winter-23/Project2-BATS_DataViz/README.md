# Bats

### Brainstorm:
- Display a picture of a bat (Would be nice if it could display an accurate picture based on species data).
- Manipulate the image according to data.
    - Color changes based on environment observed in.
    - Type of distortion based on species.
- Display species names. Fill the screen/ incorporate the text into the distortion in an interesting way (Alpha, size, color, font).
