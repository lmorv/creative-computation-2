# Double R Dinner Simulator

This program, based on the Slamina activity, simulates the experience of ordering a pie or a black coffee at the Double R Dinner, but in the Black Lodge dimension. That is to say that the client can only order today's special, which is recited in reverse by a disembodied voice.
